# E-Health Management System

This website was developed as part of my assignment for the **Object Oriented Programming** course. It was developed collaboratively by a team of three members, including myself.

It is a web-based system specifically designed for foreign workers. This platform will allow for the digital registration of personal and health information, streamline medical appointment bookings, and generate real-time health reports for relevant authorities. The system will support multiple user roles, including foreign workers, health staff, and immigration officers, ensuring secure access and efficient communication among all parties involved.
